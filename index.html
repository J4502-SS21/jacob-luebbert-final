  <h1 class="computer">So, you're a journalist who wants a new computer... Why not build it yourself!</h1>

  <ul class="main-content-flex">
    <li class="main-content-flex-item1">
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        Why, as I journalist, would you ever want to build your own computer? There are a couple reasons. Most journalists would use their laptop for most of their editing at home, and there's nothing wrong with that, but laptops are often overpriced and much
        less powerful than a personal computer (PC) that you've built yourself. For example, the new 13-inch MacBook is $1,300. It's CPU or processor is Apple's new M1 chip. According to tests, it runs a bit worse than the $199 dollar AMD Ryzen 5 3600
        processor. Graphics processing wise, the M1 chip runs a bit better than a Nvidia GTX 1050 ti, but for 200-300 dollars you could get something that would blow the M1 chip out of the water. Factoring in other costs, you could build a full PC that
        would destroy the 13-inch MacBook for about $900 dollars. That's $400 in savings for a more powerful machine that will destroy Photoshop or Premier! Of course, it's not portable, but this is more of a home office machine anyway. Long story short:
        Building a PC is cheaper and results in a better product. Here's another reason: It's fun! Millions of people build their own PCs around the world and form communities along the way. Building PCs is an amazing way to flex your creativity too!

      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>
        It's not as hard as you think. Many first-time builders compare it to an EASY version of Legos. The parts makers have spent decades standardizing the PC building process. It can get a bit confusing, but at its core it's basically just plugging things
        into other things. The Glossary on this website was made to help first time builders understand the parts of a computer and how they fit together. Use it! There's a community of millions who will help you build your PC if you get stuck. This YouTube
        video from Newegg might help first time builders.

      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>
        What parts should I buy? It depends! How cheap do you want to go? How cool do you want the PC to look? What programs are you going to be running? What's in stock? That last question might seem a bit odd, but due to a TON of different reasons (Bitcoin
        miners, tariffs, etc.) PC parts, especially graphics cards (check the Glossary if you don't know what this part is) are either more expensive or completely out of stock. It's a temporary problem, but a serious one. Luckily, there's ways around
        it. I hope through the PC Builder on this website and the Glossary, I can help you pick out the right parts!
